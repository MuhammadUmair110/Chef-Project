# Chef-Project
We select the Chef tool. Chef is a company and it is the name of configuration management tool. Chef is written in Ruby and Erlang. A chef is an administration tool. Whatever admins used to do manually, now we are automating all those tasks, by using chef.
Configuration management is a method through which we automate admin tasks. Configuration management tools turn your computer into infrastructure.  So the code would be repeatable, testable, and versionable.
